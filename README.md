# LaTeX-Printf: A Package for Placeholders in LaTeX Documents

This LaTeX package will provide commands for inserting placeholders for macros
into LaTeX documents.

A placeholder in the text contains the name of a macro.
If that macro is defined, it will be expanded.
Otherwise, a replacement will be shown in its place.

Placeholders like this can be used to create e.g. form letters or reports containing
tables. Some examples will be provided later.

## Planned Features

* Macros for placeholders with or without replacement text
* Macros for setting default replacement text
* A way to define styles for placeholders
* Summary of placeholders in the document
  * Think of it as a kind of to-do list.
* Maybe some scripts to automatically remove placeholders if needed.
