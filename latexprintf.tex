\section*{\LaTeX-Printf: A Package for Placeholders in LaTeX Documents}

This LaTeX package will provide commands for inserting placeholders for macros
into LaTeX documents.

A placeholder in the text contains the name of a macro.
If that macro is defined, it will be expanded.
Otherwise, a replacement will be shown in its place.

Placeholders like this can be used to create e.g. form letters or reports containing
tables. Some examples will be provided later.

\subsection*{Planned Features}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Macros for placeholders with or without replacement text
    \item Macros for setting default replacement text
    \item A way to define styles for placeholders
    \item Summary of placeholders in the document
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Think of it as a kind of to-do list.
      \end{itemize}
    \item Maybe some scripts to automatically remove placeholders if needed.
\end{itemize}
